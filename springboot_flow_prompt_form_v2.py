This interactive script helps you document the full lifecycle of a Spring Boot
service endpoint â€” from controller to service logic, external integrations,
error handling, and unit tests.

Use it as a personal second brain to stay organized and answer questions
confidently during meetings or code reviews.

ðŸŸ¢ Instructions:
- Answer each question to the best of your knowledge.
- You can enter multiple bullet points. Press ENTER after each line.
- Type 'done' on a new line when you're finished with a question.
- Navigation:
  <     â†’ Go to the previous question
  >     â†’ Skip the current question
  d     â†’ Finish early
